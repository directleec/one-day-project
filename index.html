                  “When guitar players talk, we talk about the great ones. We always start with the top of the scale, basically. Have you heard what Montgomery is doing? Oh, was that a fabulous recording. And how 'bout Tal Farlowe. Isn’t his technique incredible?! And, what about that thing Charlie Christian played, that’s still one of my favorite solos. But have you heard about this guitar player in Canada? His name is Lenny Breau. Yeah, man, but wait until you hear him play." - George Benson

                  “He knew the guitar so well and he had a great knowledge of Bach, the harmonies. He could play classical and jazz, many different styles. A real genius.”    Liona Boyd - Classical Guitarist.

                  “He had a fantastic sense of humor, great personality. He could sing. He was great looking. Plus, he was an incredible guitar player. I think, boy, this guy should have been an absolute major star because he had everything going for him.” Andy Summers, former lead guitarist for The Police.

                  “He came up with a way of addressing the instrument technically, that actually nobody had done before . . . and actually, in a way that nobody’s done since.”   Pat Metheny - Jazz Guitarist

                  “You know, Frank Zappa taught me the difference between "good" noodling' and "bad" noodling.” And when Lenny was noodling, it was a feast.”  Steve Vai - former lead guitarist for Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention.

                  “I suppose Lenny's work has to be called jazz, but it is beyond that or any other category of music. It is a thing unto itself. There has never been anyone like Lenny Breau, and never will be again, for music itself and for all of us.” – Gene Lees - Canadian music critic, biographer, lyricis and journalist.

                  Leonard Harold Breau (August 5, 1941 - August 12, 1984) was an American-Canadian guitarist. He blended many styles of music, including jazz, country, classical and flamenco.  Inspired by country guitarists like Chet Atkins, Breau used fingerstyle techniques not often used in jazz guitar.  Also, by employing the use of natural and fretted harmonics and by using a seven-string guitar to approach the guitar like a piano, he opened up possibilities for the instrument. Simply put, if you listen to one of his solo recordings it sounds like more than one guitar is playing at the same time. Many call him the Bill Evans of the guiar.

        <h1 class="text-center">Early Life</h1><br>
            <p class="fw-bolder">
                Breau was born August 5, 1941, in Auburn Maine. Lenny's parents, Rita and Harold “Lone Pine” Breau (aka “The Lone Pine Mountaineer”) met in Lewiston, Maine in 1939. Harold was a touring Country & Western solo artist and hired a local Lewiston back-up band called The Sons of the Westerners who recommended Rita, a local female vocalist.
                
                At a very young age, it became clear that Lenny had musical gifts. Not only did he inherit his mother's perfect pitch, at the age of two his parents could hear him vocally harmonizing (without mistakes) the perfect third part while they would rehearse their musical act in their barn. Shortly thereafter, Lenny was soon performing with his parents, singing high harmony above his mother's vocal line. His first live performances were on his parents' noontime radio show on WCOU and WLBZ in Bangor, Maine. His earnest, reedy voice was a hit with listeners and attracted so much fan mail that before long he was taking the stage with his parents at their local shows. While Lenny used a toy guitar as a stage prop, his first real instrument was a washboard with an array of attached bells and whistles. When Lenny was five his father gave him a flea-market purchased, child-size accordion with one key that stuck.
                
                In 1948 at the age of 7, Lenny moved with his family to Moncton, New Brunswick. His francophone parents, Harold Breau and Betty Cody, were professional country and western musicians who perfomred and recorded from the mid-1930s until the mid-1970s. 
                
                While Lenny started playing guitar around the age of six, his parents were not aware of his evolving guitar skills until 1949 when he played them a Hank Snow song he learned from the son of the woman who took care of him while his parents were on the road. Upon hear his performance, his father bought him a small-bodied Gibson acoustic which motivated Lenny's desire to master the instrument. Many years later, Lenny would tell journalists that if he excelled on the instrument, he would earn a permanent position in his parents’ band.
                 When he was twelve, he started a small band with friends, and by the age of fourteen he was the lead guitarist for his parents' band, billed ahs the "Lone Pine Junior", playing Merle Travis and Chet Atkins instrumentals and occasionally singing. He made his first professional recordings in Westbrook, Main at Event Records with Al Hawkes at the age of 15 while working as a studio musician.  Many of these recordings were released posthumously on the album Boy Wonder.

                The Breau family moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1957 and their new band performed around the city and province as hte CKY Caravan. Their shows were radio broadcast live on Winnipeg's CKY on Saturday mornings from remote locations.

                <p class="fw-bolder">
                    Around 1959 Breau left his parents' country band after his father slapped him in the face for incorporating jazz improvisation into his playing with the group.  He sought out localjazz musicians, performing  at Winnipeg venues Rando Manor and the Stage Door He met pianist Bob Erlendson, who began taching him more of the foundations of Jazz.

                    In 1962, Breau briefly performed in the Toronto-based jazz group Three with singer and actor Don Francks, and Elon Henstridge on acoustic bass. The three performed in Toronto, Ottawa, and New York City.  Their music was featured in the 1962 National Film Board documentary Toronto Jazz.  They also recorded a live album at the Village Vanguard in New York City and appeard on the Jackie Gleason and Joe Bisho television shows.  Shortly thereafter, Lenny returned to Winnipeg and became a studio session guitarist recording for CBC Radio and CBC Television and for a brief period had his own show called The Lenny Bureau Show. By 1967, recording of Lenny's show found their way to Chet Atkins. Chet was not only a famous country guitar player, he also produced much of what is now called the "Nashville Sound" for RCA records. Chet invited Lenny to come to Nashville and this resulted in Lenny's first two albums, Guitar Sounds from Lenny Breau and The Velvet Touch of Lenny Breau - Live! From the late 60s to the early 80s Lenny would be an active professional musican playing a wide variety of styles ranging from solo and trio jazz club appearences in the U.S. and Canada, a studio musician, lead guitarist for a variety of country, folk and popular touring vocalists like Anne Murray and Beverly Glen Copeland and mentor to The Guess Who and Bachman Turner Overdrive. He also spen time as a guest instructor for G.I.T.and writer for Guitar Player Magazine.</p><br>

            <p class="fw-bolder">
              Lenny Breau's fully matured technique wasa combination of Chet Atkins and Merle Travis' "boom-chick" fingerpicking and Sabicas-influenced flamenco, highlighted by right-hand independence and flurries of both natural and artificial harmonics.  His harmonic sensibilities were a combination of his country roots, classical music, modal, Indian and jazz, particularly the work of pianist Bill Evans. Lenny often adapted Evan's compositions, such as "Funny Man" for guitar. Breau said, in relation to this, "I play the guitar like a piano, there's always two things going on at once. I'm thinking melody, but I'm also thinking of background and accoumpanyment."

              Lenny had two custom seven-string guitars made, one classical and one electric. At the time, no company made a string that could be tuned to the high A on his classical guitar. Breau used fishing line of the correct gage until the LaBella string company started making a string for him.  Today the seven-string guitar is common in almost all musical styles from Classical to Heavy Metal and everything in between.

          <p class="fw-bolder">

          Like many other great jazz musicians, Breau had problems with drugs beginning in the 1960s, but which he managed to control the last few years of his life.  On August 12, 1984, his body was found in a swimming pool at his apartment complex in Los Angeles, CA.  The coroner reported that Breau had been strangled.  Breau's wife, Jewel, was the chief suspect, but ultimately she was not charged.  Since his passing many live and "lost" recordings and videos have surfaced.  A documentar titled The Genius of Lenny Breau was produced in 1999 by his daughter, Emily Hughes. It includes interviews with Chet Atkins, Ted Green, Pat Metheny, George Benson, Leonard Cohen and Randy Bachman. It's not inappropriate to say that Lenny Breau was the guitar player's guitar player.  While many guitar players did not know of him while he was alive, they do today.  Most non-musicians / non-guitar players have never heard of him, but most intermediate and above level guitarists in all genres know of him and pursue his repertoire and technique.  Generally speaking, what's so remarkable about Lenny and his playing is that he was never formally trained on the instrument. His level of musicianship, technique and musical interpretation was always exclusively driven by the love of what he heard others play that he would then transfer to his instrument. The result was a musician and guitar player who rose the highest level of musical interpretation and performance that rivaled the greats -from Andres Segovia to Django Rinehardt to Chet Atkins and beyond.  He viewed his instrument as if it were a piano and played it that way, too.  If you have a favorite guitar player, whoever they may be.  They know who Lenny Breau was and go out oftheir way to emulate both his style and technique.
